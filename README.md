## Instructions
1. Pull the repo to your local machine or OpenOnDemand scratch storage.
2. Create a Python environment using `requirements.txt`.
3. You can run the analysis in `timeseries_data_cleaning.ipynb` which will load the data from `temps_premade.xlsx`.
4. If you would like to make your own data, you can try running the Notebook `faker_timeseries_temp_data.ipynb`. In that case, the Notebook will output a file, `temps.xlsx` with the newly generated data.
